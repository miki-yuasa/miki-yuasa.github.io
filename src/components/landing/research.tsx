        I'm interested in developing core reinforcement learning (RL) methodologies for safety-critical applications in the real world, such as connected automated vehicles, smart cities, urban air mobility, and urban search-and-rescue missions.

        Some topics on which I am working with Professor Huy Tran at Tran Research Goup are:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Developed safe and verifiable AI and deep reinforcement learning framework using formal methods
        </li>
        <li>
          Designed a neural network from scratch, which infers robot behaviors in human-readable forms
        </li>
        <li>
          Applying the framework for motion planning of robots and autonomous vehicles (Sim2Real)
        </li>
      </ol>

        I was widely interested in aerodynamics and collaborative unmanned
        vehicles in the context of integrated intelligent transportation where
        all the aerial, ground, and marine automated vehicles require
        optimizations of the design in terms of fluid dynamics and controls on
        the interactions of vehicles. This interest led me to work in two
        laboratories: one is computational fluid dynamics lab, and the other is
        connected automated vehicles and highway lab.

        Some topics on which I have worked with Professor Jennifer Franck in the
        CFD lab are:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Dynamic Mesh Morphing: developed and implemented a dynamic mesh
          generation library for harbor seal whiskers for a CFD solver
          (OpenFOAM).
        </li>
        <li>
          Flow Control: evaluated the parametric influences of harbor seal whiskers on hydrodynamics and frequency response.
        </li>
        <li>
          Comformal Mapping: developed a mesh-generation library using
          Schwartz-Christoffel conformal mapping for 2D geometries on MATLAB
          <sup>Â®</sup> .
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Another set of topics I have worked with Professor Bin Ran in the CAVH
        lab are:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Mixed Traffic: built simulation models to evaluate how platooned
          automated vehicles can improve the network capacity on highways between Madison, WI and Chicago O'Hare Airport.
        </li>
        <li>
          Car-following Model: investigated the way to dynamically assign costs
          for individual vehicles to join and leave platoons.
        </li>
        <li>
          Weather Condition: simulated how the network capacity of highway can
          change under the snow.
        </li>
      </ol>
