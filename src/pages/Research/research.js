                    <p>I was widely interested in aerodynamics and collaborative unmanned vehicles in the context of integrated intelligent transportation where both aerial, ground, and marine automated vehicles require optimizations of the design in terms of fluid dynamics and controls on the interactions of vehicles. This interest led me to work in two laboratories: one is computational fluid dynamics lab, and the other is connected automated vehicles and highway lab.</p>
                    <p>Some topics on which I have worked with Professor Jennifer Franck in the CFD lab are:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Dynamic Mesh Generation: developed and implemented a dynamic mesh generation library for harbor seal whiskers for a CFD solver (OpenFOAM).</li>
                        <li>Flow Control: evaluated the influece of geometry transformation of harbor seal whiskers on hydrodynamic reactions.</li>
                        <li>Comformal Mapping: developed a mesh-generation library using Schwartz-Christoffel conformal mapping for 2D geometries on MATLAB<sup>Â®</sup> .</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>Another set of topics I have worked with Professor Bin Ran in the CAVH lab are:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Mixed Traffic: built simulation models to evaluate how platooned automated vehicles can improve the network capacity</li>
                        <li>Car-following Model: investigated the way to dynamically assign costs for indivicual vehicles to join and leave platoons.</li>
                        <li>Weather Condition: simulated how the network capacity of highway can change under the snow.</li>
                    </ol>
